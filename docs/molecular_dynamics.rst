**1.1 Molecular Dynamics Theory**

Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are computer simulations of a molecular 
structure over a short period of time; used to illuminate biological behavior 
that is challenging or inaccessible by in vivo methods. Simulating a molecule 
is an incalculably complex task, oftentimes quite literally, as we will see 
in this section. Therefore, a number of techniques have been developed to 
ensure our computational models are physically accurate.

In mathematics and computer science, it is customary to approach writing 
as inviting readers through the reasoning process (Su, 2015). I myself learned 
much of molecular dynamics theory in the preparation of this thesis, and I 
found it to be as informative as it was technical. Therefore, we will 
traverse this section as a series of problems and solutions to elucidate 
how the methods of this thesis developed.

*1.1.1 Force Fields Predict Potential Energy Surfaces*

The molecular structures of the ribosome used throughout this thesis were 
developed using cryo-EM (Abeyrathne et al., 2016). When we are given this 
structure, the atoms are resolved to 3.5 angstroms (Å), while a 
carbon-carbon single bond is 1.5 Å. Therefore, a number of atoms 
may not be in their true position, but rather in a position with significant 
energetic strain, which we measure as the total potential energy of the system. 
This presents us with our first problem: we must move the molecule into 
its true conformation, the most energetically favorable.

Doing so requires us to write a potential energy function, which will 
give us the energy of the system as a function of all the atom coordinates. 
Finding the most energetically favorable structure means finding the minimum 
of this function. This is often presented as a Potential Energy Surface (PES). 
Figure 1.1.1 shows the PES for water, where the potential energy function 
takes in two values, H-O-H bond angle and bond length, then returns the potential 
energy. By inputting two numbers and outputting one, we say our potential 
energy function U is a mapping :math:`\(U : \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}\)`. 
A stable structure would be found at 
an energy minimum, the lowest point on the surface.

*Figure 1.1.1: Potential Energy Surface for Water. The z-axis shows 
potential energy as two qualities of the water molecule are varied 
along the x- and y-axis. The energy minimum is found at an H-O-H 
angle of 104.5° and a bond length of 0.0958 nm (Scopino, 2020).*

For our ribosome system, that has thousands of atoms, our potential energy 
function U takes the x-, y-, z-coordinates of all of the atoms as input. 
With N atoms, this makes U a mapping :math:`\(U: \mathbb{R}^{3N}\to\mathbb{R}\)`, 
meaning we need 3N+1 axes to 
visualize the surface, which is impossible supposing a three-dimensional thesis 
reader. The lack of visualization does not, however, presuppose the lack of a minimum. 
A popular example is the function :math:`\(T: \mathbb{R}^{3} \to \mathbb{R}\)`, where T(x,y,z) 
is the temperature 
of a room at position (x, y, z) in 3D coordinates. We cannot visualize this function, 
as we would need all three dimensions for our x-, y-, z-positions and would have none 
left over for the temperature variable. Yet, this room certainly has an (x, y, z) 
position with the minimum temperature. Our ribosome PES is much the same; we may 
not be able to visualize it, but there is a configuration of atoms that begets 
the lowest potential energy.

We now arrive at the problem of designing our potential energy function. 
Ideally, our function would utilize quantum mechanics to calculate probabilistic 
electron densities and the interaction of each atom with all other atoms in the 
system. However, doing so for more than a handful of atoms becomes computationally 
infeasible. The solution: force fields.

Force fields utilize experimental data and some quantum mechanics to calculate 
a highly accurate estimate of the result of the purely quantum mechanical 
approach. By incorporating as many atomic interactions as possible, and 
making clever approximations, we can balance accuracy with computational 
efficiency to arrive at a sufficient heuristic. A number of factors are 
considered in our simulation's force field calculations.

In lieu of electron cloud overlap and solving of the complex Schrodinger 
wave equation, we can treat all bonds as two masses connected by a spring. 
Then, we can simply use Hooke's law of spring potential energy to calculate 
the potential energy induced by the stretching and compressing of all bonds 
in the structure.

.. math::
  \(U = \sum_{bonds}\frac{1}{2}k_b(r-r_0)^2\)

This is a strong start, but we can include a number of other factors. 
The oscillation of bond angles 𝜃, for instance, can also be modeled 
using Hooke's law. We then consider torsional potential induced by 
the bond rotation 𝜙. Adding these to our equation gives us:


.. math::
  \(U = \sum_{bonds}\frac{1}{2}k_b(r-r_0)^2 + \sum_{angles}\frac{1}{2}k_{\theta}(\theta-\theta_0)^2
  +\sum_{torsions}[1+cos(n\phi + \delta)]\)


Finally, we include strain due to improper dihedrals, the force that 
keeps some atoms in a plane to prevent chiral flips. To account for 
non-bonding interactions, we calculate van der Waals interactions using 
the Lennard-Jones potential, and electric potential energy between 
charged groups using Coulomb's law. These equations come together to 
form a complete force field equation to estimate the system's 
potential energy (Cowan, 2022).

.. math::
  \(U = \sum_{bonds}\frac{1}{2}k_b(r-r_0)^2 + \sum_{angles}\frac{1}{2}k_{\theta}(\theta-\theta_0)^2
  +\sum_{torsions}[1+cos(n\phi + \delta)]\)
  
.. math::
  \( + \sum_{improper}V_{imp}+ \sum_{LJ}4\epsilon_{ij}\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}^{12}}{r_{ij}^{12}}-\frac{\sigma_{ij}^{6}}{r_{ij}^{6}}\right) 
  + \sum_{elec}\frac{q_iq_j}{r_{ij}}\)

field equation considers bond length, bond angle, torsions (bond twist), 
and improper dihedrals.*

Once the potential energy is calculated, we can use a number of 
techniques to move to a local energy minimum. We should note two 
assumptions that we have made before moving to MD simulations. 
First, we assume that the cryo-EM structure is similar to the 
native structure. Second, that the native structure lies at an 
energy minimum. That way, our starting structure already begins 
in a “well” of the PES, and we simply need to adjust to the minima. 
With our energy minimized structure in hand, we can move to 
molecular dynamics.

*1.1.2 Computational Genetics*

To observe the ribosome/mRNA interactions, we utilize a 
subsystem of the ribosome containing the decoding center 
(Figure 1.1.4B). As will be explained further in the Methods 
section, the neighborhood is a 40 Å sphere centered at the 
C1054 of CAR, therefore containing the A-site codon and 
anticodon, CAR, the +1 codon, and a number of the surrounding residues.

Our goal is to explore the allosteric effect of +1 codon 
identity on the ribosome. To do so, we need cryo-EM structures 
with various +1 codons, ideally in the same stage of translocation. 
However, our structures only have a +1GCU. To account for this, 
we induce the change computationally and observe the conformational 
impact. For instance, to analyze a +1CGU structure, we must 
exchange the +1G1 and +1C2 for a +1C1 and +1G2. We delete much 
of the +1G1 and +1C2 nucleotide base from our cryo-EM +1GCU 
structure, keeping only the atoms that are in common with the 
+1C1 and +1G2 we are adding. Then, we use AMBER's tLEaP to 
“grow in” the two new nucleotides: +1C1 and +1G2. We can then 
implement the energy minimization methods discussed in 
Section 1.1.1 to relax the steric tension of this addition 
and observe the structural changes.

Recently, the Weir laboratory has found that +1 codon identity 
may, by itself, be too simplified a regulation model. In Sun et al.,
we hypothesize that codon adjacency—a pair of codons in the 
A-site and +1 site—provides a more nuanced regulation story. We 
found that +1GCU codons following an NNU A- site codon had 
elevated ribosome densities (indicating slower translation), 
more H-bonds with CAR in MD, and were overrepresented in yeast 
reading frames when compared to +1GCU following NNC (Sun et al., 2024). 
Here, we expand this analysis to novel A-site codons and tRNA 
anticodons to investigate the impact of A-site identity on the overall 
subsystem conformation.

These studies are given the name “computational genetics,” and it 
is an apt one. As with many genetics studies, we too are inducing 
a mutation and observing a phenotypic change. Our study is in silico,
via a computational medium, rather than in vivo.

*1.1.3 MD Unveils New Energy Minima*

Our desire to explore more complex structures brings new problems, 
though we can view these as opportunities for more clever solutions. 
Unlike the PES of water shown in Figure 1.1.1, structures as complex 
as our ribosome have a number of conformations that are energetically 
stable, therefore a number of minima on the potential energy surface 
(Figure 1.1.3). However, our energy minimum algorithm described in 
Section 1.1.1 moves directly “downhill” to the local minimum. 
Additionally, interconversion between these wells may require 
overcoming a transition state that is too unfavorable.

Molecular dynamics (MD) overcomes this by heating the system to a higher-energy 
state and running multiple replicates to sample as many conformations as possible. 
Heating encompasses distributing initial velocities to all the atoms of the 
structure based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann law (Mozetič et al., 2019). With our 
heated structure now able to roam high-energy positions on the PES, we 
can apply molecular kinematics to quench the system into a new energy minimum. 
The kinematics are simply an expansion of the force field potential 
energy equation in Section 1.1.1, which we convert to atomic movement. 
The negative derivative of our potential energy U gives the force F on 
an atom, which we input into Newton's second law along with the atomic mass 
to calculate acceleration a:


.. math::
  -\frac{dU}{dt} = F = ma \Rightarrow a = \frac{F}{m}

We apply each atom's acceleration to adjust the atomic velocities and, 
therefore, positions at discrete timesteps. The new atomic positions 
create a novel structural conformation, called a frame, with an updated 
potential energy U for each atom. This is the cycle of MD simulation: 
a structure—or “topology”—gives potential energy U for each atom, 
which informs atomic acceleration and, therefore, atomic position 
in a new topology frame. We can stitch together a sequence of frames 
into a “trajectory,” much like the frames in a movie. The number 
of frames and therefore time length of each MD replicate is 
described further in Section 2.1.3.
